A ray tracing based renderer, implemented following the book Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley. 

This implementation of the renderer build in this book includes multithreading support, allowing for greatly reduced compute times, as well as a window showing the progress of the render in real time using OpenGL.
